# sitefinity-net-core-assets
Assets management project for Sitefinity .Net core renderer

This is a boilerplate template that can help with managing the assets for your project (fonts, image, styles, scripts). Copy `client-src` directory inside your .NET Core renderer.

## Usage
In `client-src` directory open terminal and run `npm i` followed by `npm start`. This will minify the SCSS files to CSS, uglify the scripts and move them to `wwwroot` directory. It will also watch for changes.
